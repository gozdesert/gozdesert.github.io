  abstract = {This work introduces a novel Bayesian semi-supervised inference method for population mean estimation that improves efficiency by modeling specific summary statistics instead of the raw data. The proposed approach utilizes a new Bayesian debiasing technique to produce more robust and efficient estimators, with its effectiveness validated through theoretical results and extensive numerical studies.}

  abstract = {We introduce a semiparametric Bayesian methodology for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) that utilizes a novel Bayesian debiasing procedure and a targeted modeling strategy based on summary statistics. This approach achieves Bayesian double robustness, ensuring the posterior inference is asymptotically efficient and valid even with high-dimensional data and potential model misspecification.}
